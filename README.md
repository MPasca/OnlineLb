# OnlineLb
My SD projects consists in a website for an online library.
There are two types of users: readers and admins.

The readers can browse through the materials in the library, book them and open and view digital materials.
The admins can see the readers' history, what materials are borrowed, who borrowed them and also add, edit or delete materials from the database.

So far I've configured the database to the projects with the dependencies in maven, I installed PostMan, I created this repository, I created this readme and more are yet to come.
